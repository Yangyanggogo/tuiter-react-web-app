<h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
<h2>Style attribute and tag</h2>
<h3>Style attribute</h3>
<p style="background-color: blue; color: white">
  Style attribute allows configuring look
  and feel right on the element. Although it's 
  very convenient it is considered bad practice 
  and you should avoid using the style attribute
</p>
</body>
</html>

<head>
    <!-- <style>
        p {
            background-color: gray;
            color: white;
        }
    </style> -->
    <link href="index.css"
         rel="stylesheet"/>
 </head>
 <h3>Link tag</h3>
<p>
   The best way to apply CSS rules is to declare
   them in a separate CSS file and load it with 
   the LINK tag. Always use this method.
</p>

<h3>ID selectors</h3>
<p id="id-selector-1">
 Instead of changing the look and
 feel of all the elements of the 
 same name, e.g., P, we can refer 
 to a specific element by its ID
</p>
<p id="id-selector-2">
 Here's another paragraph using a
 different ID and a different look 
 and feel
</p>

<h3>Class selectors</h3>
<p class="class-selector">
 Instead of using IDs to refer
 to elements, you can use an
 element's CLASS attribute</p>
<h4 class="class-selector">
 This heading has same style as
 paragraph above</h4>

 <div class="selector-1">
    <h3>Document structure selectors</h3>
    <div class="selector-2">
     Selectors can be combined to refer elements in
     particular places in the document
     <p class="selector-3">
      This paragraph's red background is referenced as
      <br/>.selector-2 .selector3<br/>
      meaning the descendant of some ancestor.
      <br/>
      <span class="selector-4">Whereas this span is a
        direct child of its parent</span>
      <br/>
      You can combine these relationships to create
      specific styles depending on the document 
      structure
     </p>
    </div>
   </div>
   
   <h2>Colors</h2>
   <h3 class="fg-color-blue">Foreground color</h3>
   <p class="fg-color-red">
     The text in this paragraph is red but
     <span class="fg-color-green">this text is green</span>
   </p>
   
   <h2>Margins</h2>
   <div class="margin-bottom 
               padded-top-left 
               border-fat border-red 
               border-solid 
               bg-color-yellow">
      Margin bottom</div>
   <div class="margin-right-left 
               padded-bottom-right 
               border-fat border-blue 
               border-solid 
               bg-color-yellow">
      Margin left right
   </div>
   <div class="margin-all-around 
               padding-fat border-fat 
               border-yellow 
               border-solid 
               bg-color-blue 
               fg-color-white">
      Margin all around
   </div>
   <h3>Fixed position</h3>

   Checkout the blue square that says 
   "Fixed position" stuck all the way 
   on the right and half way down the 
   page. It doesn't scroll with the 
   rest of the page. Its position is 
   "Fixed".
 
 <div class="pos-fixed 
             dimension-square 
             bg-color-blue 
             fg-color-white">
   Fixed position
 </div>
